## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup

1. **Power Supply:** Connect a suitable power supply to the board.
2. **USB Connection:** Use the onboard USB port for programming and debugging.

### Programming

1. Install the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) following the [official documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/).
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-devkitc-32ue.git`
3. Navigate to the project folder: `cd esp32-devkitc-32ue`
4. Configure the project: `idf.py menuconfig`
5. Build and flash the project: `idf.py -p PORT flash`

### Examples
This simple program configures GPIO pin 2 as an output and toggles the state of the pin to make an LED connected to it blink.

#include <stdio.h>
#include "freertos/FreeRTOS.h"
#include "freertos/task.h"
#include "driver/gpio.h"

#define LED_PIN GPIO_NUM_2 // Assuming an LED is connected to GPIO pin 2

void app_main() {
    gpio_pad_select_gpio(LED_PIN);
    gpio_set_direction(LED_PIN, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);

    while (1) {
        gpio_set_level(LED_PIN, 1);
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
        gpio_set_level(LED_PIN, 0);
        vTaskDelay(1000 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}


## Applications

This development board is suitable for a variety of applications, including:

- **IoT Devices:** Build connected devices for the Internet of Things.
- **Home Automation:** Create smart home devices and systems.
- **Robotics:** Control and communicate with robots using the board's capabilities.
- **Industrial Automation:** Implement automation solutions for industrial processes.
