To use the ESP32-DEVKITC-32UE as a WiFi local network provider, you can use the Arduino framework with the ESP32 core for Arduino, which includes support for the ESP32 microcontroller. Here's a basic example code in C++ using the Arduino framework:

#include <WiFi.h>

const char *ssid = "your-ssid";
const char *password = "your-password";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Connect to Wi-Fi
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  }

  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");
  Serial.print("IP Address: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
Replace "your-ssid" and "your-password" with your WiFi network SSID and password. This code will connect your ESP32 to the WiFi network and print its IP address to the Serial Monitor.


For the Python part, you can create a simple server using the socket module. Here's an example:

import socket

host = '0.0.0.0'  # Listen on all available interfaces
port = 8080

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind((host, port))
server_socket.listen(5)

print(f"Listening on {host}:{port}")

while True:
    client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Accepted connection from {addr}")

    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print(f"Received data: {data.decode()}")

    response = "Hello from ESP32!"
    client_socket.send(response.encode())

    client_socket.close()
